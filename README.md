## Safety

The Wisconsin Photoreactor is for use by trained chemistry researchers and should be handled carefully. 

The Wisconsin Photoreactor platform utilizes high-intensity LEDs which can cause eye damage if looked at directly.
Light-filtering safety glasses should be worn whenever the photoreactor light source is powered on.
LEDs emitting different colors will require different types of light-filtering safety glasses for protection.
Extra precuation should be taken around ultra-violet and near infra-red light sources emitting "invisible" light.
