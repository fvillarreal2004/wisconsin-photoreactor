# WPP Standardized Base

![WPP base](./base.jpg)

The core structure of the Wisconsin Photoreactor Platform. Each reactor shares this component.

Through variation of the LED star integrated into a base, the user can control the wavelengths of light delivered by the photon source to a reaction vessel. 
See fabrication instructions for LED star installation instructions. See `photon-source-leds` directory for list of LED stars confirmed compatible with the WPP architecture.

All prices are extended estimates in USD.
In general these are overestimates, so this should be an upper-estimate on cost.
