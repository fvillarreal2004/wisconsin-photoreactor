# Digital Controller

The digital driver board can be controlled using a "digital control unit."
Potential digital control units include Arduino microcontrollers or Rasberry Pi devices.
These control units can "supervise" the light intensity and fan speed of WPP devices fitted with digital driver boards.

Custom control unit firmware is required to enable  supervision of digital driver boards.
Open-source firmware for controlling an digital driver board with an Ardunio microcontroller is provided.

Instructions on using this firmware with an Arduino microcontroller is provided in the fabrication and operation instructions.
