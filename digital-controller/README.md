# Digital Controller

The digital driver board can be controlled using a "digital control unit."
Potential digital control units include Arduino or Rasberry Pi devices.
These control units can "supervise" the light intensity and fan speed of WPP devices fitted with digital driver boards.

Custom control unit firmware is required to interface with digital driver boards.
Open-source firmware for controlling a digital driver board with an Ardunio Uno is provided.
See the firmware files for use instructions.

Instructions on connecting an Arduino Uno to a digital driver board are provided in the fabrication and operation instructions.
