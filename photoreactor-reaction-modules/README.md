# Photoreactor Reaction Modules

![WPP modules](./modules.jpg)

A WPP reaction module consists of a reflective reaction chamber and rigid vessel holder. 

By modifying chamber height and adjusting holder geometry, one can produce modules compatible with reaction vessels of various types and sizes. 
Template reaction chamber and vessel holder CAD designs are provided in the `template` directory. 

CAD designs and 3D-printable models for modules compatible with various common reaction vessel are provided in this directory. A table listing vessels with already created reaction modules is offered below.
