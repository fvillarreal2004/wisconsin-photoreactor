## Safety

The Wisconsin Photoreactor Platform is for use by trained chemists.

WPP apparatuses utilize high-intensity light emitting diodes (LED) that can cause eye damage if proper safety precautions are not observed. 
A light-blocking shield should be utilized whenever operating a WPP apparatus.
Care must be taken to ensure the light-blocking shield employed adequately blocks light emitted by a WPP photon source from directly reaching a user.
Use of light-filtering safety glasses alongside a light-blocking shield can provide additional protection.

## Fabrication and Operation Instructions

This repository contains detailed instructions for fabrication, operation and documentation of WPP devices.

## Enclosure

The WPP is designed around a mechanically robust and simple 3D printed enclosure.

Every WPP device has the same base, see directory `photoreactor-base`.
WPP reaction modules are meant to be switched based on the reaction vessel used.
See directory `photoreactor-reaction-modules` for our growing collection of reaction modules for common vessel types.
For safe WPP device operation, a light blocking shield is recommended. 
See directory `photoreactor-light-shield`, for a 3D-printable light-blocking cover for WPP devices.

## Electronics

The WPP incorporates small custom circuit boards providing control over reaction conditions.
Please see the fabrication instructions for more detailed information.
