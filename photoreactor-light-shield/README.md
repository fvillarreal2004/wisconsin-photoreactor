# WPP light shield

![WPP cover](./cover.png)

A 3D-printable, light-blocking cover for Wisconsin Photoreactor Platform devices.
This generic cover module fits all WPP reaction modules. 
No customization of cover geometry is required.

The WPP light shield provides protection from direct exposure to light from WPP photon sources.
Printing the WPP light shield cover module using black filament is recommended to reduce light bounce.
Use of light-filtering safety glasses or additional light-blocking shields alongside the WPP light shield module is recommended for additional protection.
